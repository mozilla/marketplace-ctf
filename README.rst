This repo is for a Marketplace security CTF challenge. This was first done at
the Mozilla Marketplace work week in Portland in Jan 2013 as an experiment.

For instructions please see README.txt in each round.

There is a presentation at presentation/index.html. But
please note, this also contains the answers.
