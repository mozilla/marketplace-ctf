So we've closed down the hole in Round 3. And added a description field where
you can add some HTML. Also actually added a working Approve and Deny button.
*Note* the reviewer will look at the review page, but won't be able to decide.

Goal: **Get your app approved**

To run: python app.py

To see what a reviewer would do run: phantomjs reviewer.js http://localhost:5000

That will show you how a reviewer would log in.
